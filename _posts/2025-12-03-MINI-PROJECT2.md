# DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE SHADOW OF CORRUPTION

In my project, I am trying to explore some reasonsbehind the lack of basic needs: access to clean drinking water for the People of Chitral and suggest a solution. Despite decades of development efforts, many communities still struggle to secure reliable and safe water. But why does this problem persist? A project study delves into this question by comparing two very different institutions working to provide drinking water in Chitral:
1.	The Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) KPK: a government body with formal authority and financial resources.
2.	The Water and Sanitation Extension Program (WASEP): an NGO known for its community-first approach.
   
The findings provide a fascinating insight into how institutional culture, accountability, and community engagement influence development outcomes, particularly in areas where corruption and weak governance persist as everyday realities. And this study suggests co-production as a solution to this problem.

# Corpus

My corpus for this study is an analysis of textual, institutional, and qualitative materials about corruption and development, such as interviews, field observation notes, news reports, and academic literature.

# Data Sources
 
•	Kaggal: Dawn news data about 3500 aritcle links 

•	World Development Indicators (WDI): The WDI is the WBG's premier compilation of comparable data on overall development, including social, economic, and environmental indicators, which can be cross-referenced with corruption data.

 # Analytical Goals
The study ultimately aims to understand why government-led water schemes struggle despite having adequate resources, and why NGO-led initiatives, such as WASEP, demonstrate stronger results; therefore, the project focuses on
1. Mapping Governance Failures
Identify patterns of corruption, weak accountability, and lack of community involvement that affect government performance.
Identifying areas of pakistan having a huge datas about corruption and analyzing why it happens in this areas.

# Digital-Method
I have acquired several analytical and visualization skills in my coursework in Digital Humanities, which I am now ready to utilize in my project.
I want to apply the Topic modelling with BERT topic for my project which I have learnt from my course ; Digital Humanities 


# Challenges
Working on a project related to Governance and development-related data has several difficulties. First, Inadequate availability of data is also a major challenge because government records are not complete and or sometimes not available, especially corruption-related records,therefore,news report cant mention the exact figure.Another issue is its risky job to report corruption matter, most of the news reporters and channels change their stands in some cases it will create a little bit problem for me.
